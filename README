NAME
    Web::ID - implementation of WebID (a.k.a. FOAF+SSL)

SYNOPSIS
     my $webid = Web::ID->new(certificate => $pem_encoded_x509);
     if ($webid->valid)
     {
       say "Authenticated as: ", $webid->uri;
     }

DESCRIPTION
    WebID is a simple authentication protocol based on TLS (Transaction
    Layer Security, better known as Secure Socket Layer, SSL) and the
    Semantic Web. This module provides a Perl implementation for
    authenticating clients using WebID.

    For more information see the Web::ID::FAQ document.

    Bundled with this module are Plack::Middleware::Auth::WebID, a plugin
    for Plack to perform WebID authentication on HTTPS connections; and
    Web::ID::Certificate::Generator, a module that allows you to generate
    WebID-enabled certificates that can be installed into web browsers.

  Constructor
    "new"
        Standard Moose-style constructor. (This class uses Any::Moose.)

  Attributes
    "certificate"
        A Web::ID::Certificate object representing and x509 certificate,
        though a PEM-encoded string will be coerced.

        This is usually the only attribute you want to pass to the
        constructor. Allow the others to be built automatically.

    "first_valid_san"
        Probably fairly uninteresting. This is the first subjectAltName
        value found in the certificate that could be successfully
        authenticated using Web::ID. An Web::ID::SAN object.

    "uri"
        The URI associated with the first valid SAN. A URI object.

        This is a URI you can use to identify the person, organisation or
        robotic poodle holding the certificate.

    "profile"
        Data about the certificate holder. An RDF::Trine::Model object.
        Their FOAF file (probably).

    "valid"
        Boolean.

  Methods
    "node"
        Returns the same as "uri", but as an RDF::Trine::Node object.

    "get(@predicates)"
        Queries the "profile" for triples of the form:

          $self->node $predicate $x .

        And returns literal and URI values for $x, as strings.

        $predicate should be an RDF::Trine::Node, or a string. If a string,
        it will be expanded using RDF::Trine::NamespaceMap, so you can do
        stuff like:

          my $name   = $webid->get('foaf:name', 'rdfs:label');
          my @mboxes = $webid->get('foaf:mbox');

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
  Any::Moose
    This module uses Any::Moose which means that if it detects that you're
    using the rather heavyweight Moose toolkit, then this module will use it
    too. But if you're not using it, then this module will use the
    lighter-weight Mouse toolkit.

    Similarly, this module will use either MouseX::Types or MooseX::Types.

    As the decision to use Moose or Mouse is made at runtime, this makes
    expressing Web::ID's dependencies rather challenging. Web::ID requires
    either:

    *   Any::Moose,

    *   Mouse, and

    *   MouseX::Types

    or:

    *   Any::Moose,

    *   Moose, and

    *   MooseX::Types

    The installation script for Web-ID checks the first set of dependencies,
    but if you only ever plan on using Moose, and never Mouse, then you
    don't need them - you need the second set.

    Yes, it's possible to have the installation script figure out a list of
    dependencies dynamically when you install Web-ID, but that's not
    especially helpful, as Any::Moose makes its decision about what module
    to use at run time, not at install time.

    The long and the short of it is: if you use Web::ID as part of a Moose
    application, then make sure you have MooseX::Types installed.

    RDF::ACL provides an access control system that complements WebID.

    CGI::Auth::FOAF_SSL is the spiritual ancestor of this module though they
    share very little code, and have quite different APIs.

THANKS
    Thanks to Kjetil Kjernsmo (cpan:KJETILK) for persuading me to port my
    old CGI-specific implementaton of this to Plack.

    Thanks to Henry Story, Melvin Carvalho, Bruno Harbulot, Ian Jacobi and
    many others for developing WebID from a poorly thought out idea to a
    clever, yet simple and practical authentication protocol.

    Thanks to Gregory Williams (cpan:GWILLIAMS), Tatsuhiko Miyagawa
    (cpan:MIYAGAWA) and the Moose Cabal for providing really good platforms
    (RDF::Trine, Plack and Moose respectively) to build this on.
